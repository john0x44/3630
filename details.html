                        <li class="list-group-item" ><strong>Relational Database:</strong> relational database means where data is organized into tables which are made up of rows and columns. 
                            The tables are related to each other through common data.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Record:</strong> A single row in a database table that holds all the data for one item.</li>

                        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Tables:</strong> The database is broken up into tables can use ids to connect to other tables in other words there are relations between them.
                            A table contains rows and columns, in a database colums are reffered to fields and rows are reffered to as records.
                            Columns are broken down because they can be easily accessed. Tables can relate to each other via primary keys or references</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Primary Keys:</strong> primary key minimum number of columns needed to identify a record or in other words a unique identifier for each record in a table which helps to uniquely
                            identify and access data

                    <h3>Joins</h3>
                    <p>Joins combine data from multiple tables. For example:</p>
                    <p>If we want to get columns from the table named orders such as order id, order date, order total 
                        and include a customer name and customer phone column we can use join on the primary key referencing the table customers that has a primary key called customer id 
                        which has columns with costumer name and customer phone 
                        we can utilize a JOIN query for example 
                    <code>
                        <p>
                        SELECT OrderID, OrderDate, OrderTotal, CustomerName, Phone <br>
                        FROM Orders <br>
                        JOIN Customers <br>
                        ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
                        </p>
                    </code>
                    </p>
                    <p>This type of join is called an inner join which simply combines rows from two tables based on a matching condition here we are matching with customer id</p>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="fw-bold">Benefits & How It Was Mastered</h3>
                </p>
                    The benefits of learning SQL and database is essential for developing almost every software as it is most crucial backend process that happens within the software itself.
                    With SQL you can efficiently and effectively manage, analyze, and modify data allowing for seamless data management capabilities. Mastering this skill is essential for any 
                    software development project and you have a skill that is beneficial for job opportunities. 
                <p>
                </p>
                    How I mastered this skill was by following youtube tutorials, following SQL documentation, and developing software that requires database processing. Throughout this learning 
                    process my skill in this area has grown to which has benefitted me in my software development career.
